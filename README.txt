To run the logistical regression algorithm:

1. Unzip the folder keeping all current documents within its container
2. Download the dependencies required for this program: Python and the libraries Pandas and Sklearn
3. Open the folder in any IDE (Note: Model only tested within Jupiter Notebook)
4. Run the program
5. The program is run on a set seed and hence to get a different outcome the 'random_state" value in line 25 must be changed. 
6. Optionally there are more features present in the dataset that are not included within the model. To add these features insert the name of the feature in '' on line 13.

Note I wrote this code for the algorithm in machine learning a year and a half ago so I don't remember every function of it.
